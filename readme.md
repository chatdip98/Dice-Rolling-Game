The GAME OF LUCK lets you test your luck to guess the outcome
of a rolling dice. The rules are pretty simple.
You will have to guess a number of the dice, i.e. a number
in between (1-6). The computer in its memory rolls a dice
and gets a number. If your guess is correct, you get 1 point
else, each incorrect answer deducts 1 life.
You have 5 lives or 5 incorrect guesses to make.
Try this out, it is easy but addictive.
